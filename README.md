# Presto   
## An easy-to-use game installer

### `WARNING: this is currently highly experimental`

#### Currently working:
- Can show a list of games
- Can download, unzip & install a game
- Will let you setup a configuration directory

#### TODO:
- Need to add a way to check if the game is already installed
- Need to download data files for the game
- Need to do crossplatform testing
